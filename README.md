# safenet-token-access
A quick program demonstrating how to access your Safenet token from Java.

This includes the .dylib files for use on mac, if your using windows/linux you'll need to access the drivers for the respective platforms.
I found it hard to get information on how to do this, so thought this might help others in that situation.

Cheers
